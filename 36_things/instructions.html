        <strong>Why I did it:</strong>
        The ideas was to divide a subsegment of Washington Square Park into a grid. 
        I chose a short walkway framed by 2 rows of 12 benches near the Eastern exit of the park. 
        Each bench was a square of the grid, along with the bench-lengthed piece of pavement beside it. 
        <mark>24</mark> benches <mark>+</mark> the walkway between, in increments of <mark>12</mark> = 36 things. 
        The top of the grid faced West and the bottom faced East. 
        It was a mental grid - there were no real gridlines there. 
        I imagined the divides in my head.<br><br>

        I wrote about each first person, bird, or occurrence that happened in the grid square during a definite span of time, until the grid filled up (though I mostly wrote about people). 
        Things I took note of were what they looked like, what colors they wore, what I could read of their faces, who they were with or if they were alone, which way they walked and how they walked, if they noticed I was writing about them, and so on. 
        I jotted down information about strangers in a lesser amount of time than it would take for me to even form a proper impression of them.<br><br> 
        
        This isn&rsquo;t about accurately depicting what I saw or heard at that specific place and time. 
        This was about how I, (along with probably the world&rsquo;s population), project ideas onto people.<br><br>

        The details I wrote about were often extremely specific and were always completely arbitrary. 
        After I wrote about these people, I picked any file from my computer that I could associate with them to bookmark/embed that moment and stranger into something else, but not completely represent them. 
        Sometimes the associated &ldquo;thing&rdquo; related to the person&rsquo;s surface details or how I thought they felt, other times I was just trying to connect two dots.<br><br>
        
        Everything I translated onto 36 things was filtered through the lens of my own lifeâ€™s experiences/memories/knowledge/ignorance/opinions/feelings. 
        I saw things the way I wanted to. We all do, almost all the time.<br><br>
        
        So when you take things out of their original context and put into in a new narrative, rigged by the narrator&rsquo;s subjectivity, you get something new, and that is how stories used to be told and how they&rsquo;ve changed over time. 
        This archive is my very own disjunct, site-specific story, told through 36 other people.<br><br><br>


        <strong>How to use it:</strong>
        Use these media files as prompts/starting points for your own projects. 
        My roommate once said that Washington Square Park was an &rsquo;unspoken meeting place amongst strangers&rsquo;. 
        Meet some strangers.
