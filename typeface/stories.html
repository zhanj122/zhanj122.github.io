            I texted/emailed/Facebook messaged some friends this: 
            &ldquo;I'm collecting stories from people (about 2-3 sentences in length) 
            about a life-changing experience/moment for them. 
            If you would like to, please share something with me. 
            It will be posted on a website somewhere, but it will be anonymous.
            Your story can be anything that has changed you in any way.
            It doesn't have to be big.&rdquo;
            Here are their <a href="story_1.html">responses</a>.
