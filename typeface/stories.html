            I texted/emailed/Facebook messaged some friends this: 
            &ldquo;I'm collecting stories from people about a life-changing experience/moment for them, 
            so if you would like to, please share with me story. 
            It can be something or anything that has changed you in some or any way.&rdquo;
            Here are their <a href="story_1.html">responses</a>.
